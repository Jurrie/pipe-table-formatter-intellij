#Pipe Table Formatter Plugin
This is a pipe table formatter plugin for the IntelliJ platform.
It utilizes the pipe table formatter program by Jurrie Overgoor (see [the repository](https://github.com/Jurrie/pipe-table-formatter)), which normally watches for file changes.
This plugin provides the same functionality, but as an action, which can be used from a context menu or with a gitshortcut.
